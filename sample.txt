She has been in a Stop cooking with cheese advert, she talks to her neighbour about having rats. The last one I can think of is a Canadian Tire commerical where she runs over a scooter in a parking spot, the commerical is about getting a mini cam to see better behind your vehical.&#xa;&#xa;I also think she was in a bunch of Special K cereal bar commericals? Her line was "we don't get that" referring to not watching one's weight.&#xa;&#xa;At least someone tell me I'm not crazy and they have noticed she's everywhere on TV!

<subject>What is the scientific reason to morning wood?</subject><content>I was once told that it was an evolutionary feature - that in prehistoric times cavemen used to sleep outdoors on hilly terrain. And sometimes in the night they would roll down hill to their death. Over time, they developed a self-defense mechanism called morning wood that acted like a kickstand, preventing them from rolling down hill at dawn's early light. Those who got morning wood survived and passed their genes on and now all men get it in the wee hours of morning - even though we don't sleep outside on hilly terrain any more!&#xa;&#xa;-Is this true?</content><maincat>Relationships</maincat>

I personally think this was no big deal, he called the man what he was. Look, there are white people, black people, crackers/white trash, niggers, etc. I'm not calling all black people nigger but there certainly are some of them -- the rude, loud, ignorant, and obnoxious ones. If you call someone a cracker, it's not nearly as bad as calling someone a nigger.&#xa;&#xa;Michael Richards might have lost his cool, but he wasn't EXTREMELY out of line. The guys were talking during his entire show! Like one of the YouTube'rs commented, if Chris Rock had said this, this wouldn't even be an issue.&#xa;&#xa;Again, I'm not a racist, this is merely how I feel about this issue.
