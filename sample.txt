<subject>1996 Mazda MPV No spark?</subject><content>It's me again.  I changed the distributor out with a new one.  No luck.  Someone suggested the crankshaft sensor.  I checked the resistance and got within tolerance on the sensor.   Were do I go from here?????  Hopefully not to the shop.  Thanks for your help in advance.  When trying to crank, the rotar rotated and the camshaft rotated.  Guess this means it isn't a broken timing chain.</content><maincat>Transportation</maincat>
<subject>Good excuses not to drink alcohol?</subject><content>Okay, I'm trying to lose weight and want some excuses to say no when my friends offer me alcohol without seeming like a prude. Everybody knows that I like alcohol but I don't want to drink it anymore because not only does it come from sugar, when I drink it makes me weaker in saying no to greasy and sugary foods. So what are some excuses I can say for not drinking?</content><maincat>Health</maincat>
<subject>I'm not sure how this works???</subject><content>I am due 4/25/07. I had my last period on the 19th of July. Now I don't understand the fertile and conception dates. Online it says I was fertile from July 30th-August 5th. Also online says the conception date was the 2nd of July. So I guess my question is how on earth do they calculate this. I haven't had an ultrasound yet. This is my first pregnancy. New to this. Help would be great! Thanks in return.!! :)</content><maincat>Parenting</maincat>
